# TicTacToe

Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as "X and O" or "Noughts and Crosses," is a classic two-player strategy game. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the objective is simple: players take turns marking empty cells with their respective symbols, "X" and "O", with the goal of forming a winning combination of three in a row, column, or diagonal. This Java implementation brings this timeless game to life on the command line.

Before starting the game, you'll be prompted to enter the names of the two players. This customization allows you to play against friends and add a personal touch to the gaming experience.

Once the player names are set, you can start the game. Players will take turns inputting their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The game will validate the moves and display the updated board after each turn.

The game logic checks for a win condition after each player's move. If a player successfully forms a winning combination, the game will declare them as the winner. If all cells are filled, and no winner is determined, the game ends in a draw.

This Java Tic-Tac-Toe game provides an enjoyable experience for two players, allowing you to challenge your friends in the ultimate battle of wits.
